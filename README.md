# Welcome to my statically generated blog using Next.js, Markdown, and TypeScript

It's based on the [blog-starter](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter) example with some modifications :)

The blog posts are stored in `/_posts` as Markdown files with front matter support. Adding a new Markdown file in there will create a new blog post.
